# AWS-Capstone-Project-1
In this project, we create a VPC with public and private subnets, deploy a NAT Gateway, and set up an Auto Scaling Group attached to an Application Load Balancer with two target groups: testing and web. Route 53 provides a domain name, and dynamic scaling increases instances based on CPU load.
