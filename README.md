# AWS-Capstone-Project-1
In this project, we create a VPC with public and private subnets, deploy a NAT Gateway, and set up an Auto Scaling Group attached to an Application Load Balancer with two target groups: testing and web. Route 53 provides a domain name, and dynamic scaling increases instances based on CPU load.


This project focuses on designing and deploying a highly available, scalable, and secure infrastructure on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The objective is to build a complete network architecture consisting of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with both public and private subnets, along with essential components such as a NAT Gateway, Application Load Balancer (ALB), Auto Scaling Group (ASG), and Route 53 DNS configuration. The goal is to ensure that the application runs efficiently with automated scaling, reliable routing, and secure access control.
We will begin by creating a dedicated VPC that will serve as the foundational network layer for all AWS resources. Inside this VPC, two types of subnets will be configured: public subnets for internet-facing components and private subnets for backend EC2 instances. The NAT Gateway will be deployed in one of the public subnets to allow outbound internet access for instances running in the private subnets, without exposing them directly to the internet.
Next, an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) will be created to manage EC2 instances based on real-time workload demand. The ASG will be attached to an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to ensure even traffic distribution across all running instances. Two separate Target Groups will be configured under the ALB: one named Testing Target Group and the other named Web Target Group. These target groups will help route traffic intelligently based on application requirements.
To ensure that users can access the application easily and with a professional domain name, Amazon Route 53 will be used to configure DNS routing. A custom domain will be mapped to the ALB, enabling smooth and user‑friendly access to the application endpoints.
Finally, Dynamic Auto Scaling will be enabled using CloudWatch metrics. When CPU utilization exceeds a defined threshold, the ASG will automatically increase the number of EC2 instances to handle the higher load. Similarly, when demand decreases, the number of instances will automatically scale down, ensuring cost‑efficient resource utilization.
